## Aquae Speculo

This was an independent piece of work for which I had to create a web site for a pseudo company.
I was told the website should be implemented using the latest web technologies; HTML 5 and CSS 3 and Appropriate supporting scripting should be used, such as JavaScript, as required.
I was not allowed to use front end frameworks, such as Bootstrap and Foundation.

### Viewing the Website

To view the website, open the "index.html" file in your preferred browser.
To do this, simply drag the file into the browser.
